# Project Compression

A simple yet effective **file compression and decompression web app**, built as a test of skills by **Dev Panchal**.  
Currently, the app supports **`.txt` ↔ `.bin` conversions** with up to **~60% compression** for files sized **up to 3 MB**.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [project-compression.onrender.com](https://project-compression.onrender.com)

## 🚀 Features
- 🔄 **Compress** `.txt` files into `.bin` format  
- 🔓 **Decompress** `.bin` files back into `.txt` (including those previously generated by this tool)  
- 📉 Achieves ~60% file size reduction  
- 📂 Handles files up to **3 MB**  
- 🌐 Deployed and hosted on **Render**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (UI for uploading/downloading files)  
- **Backend:** Node.js (manages requests, spawns Python processes)  
- **Compression Engine:** Python (core compression & decompression logic)  
- **Hosting:** Render  

---

## 📖 How It Works
1. Upload a `.txt` file → backend compresses it via Python → download the `.bin` file.  
2. Upload the **same `.bin` file** → backend decompresses it → download the **original `.txt`** file.  

This ensures a full round-trip of **compression → decompression** without data loss.

## 📌 Roadmap
- [ ] Support additional file types (PDF, DOCX, Images, etc.)  
- [ ] Improve compression ratio further  
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop upload support  
- [ ] Enable file history & authentication  
- [ ] Optimize Python integration for faster performance
